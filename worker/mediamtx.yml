# Timeout of read operations.
readTimeout: 10s
# Timeout of write operations.
writeTimeout: 10s
# Number of read buffers.
# A higher value allows a wider throughput, a lower value allows to save RAM.

# HTTP URL to perform external authentication.
# Every time a user wants to authenticate, the server calls this URL

# If the response code is 20x, authentication is accepted, otherwise
# it is discarded.

# Path parameters

# These settings are path-dependent, and the map key is the name of the path.
# It's possible to use regular expressions by using a tilde as prefix.
# For example, "~^(test1|test2)$" will match both "test1" and "test2".
# For example, "~^prefix" will match all paths that start with "prefix".
# The settings under the path "all" are applied to all paths that do not match
# another entry.
paths:
  all:
    # Source of the stream. This can be:
    # * publisher -> the stream is published by a RTSP or RTMP client
    # * rtsp://existing-url -> the stream is pulled from another RTSP server / camera
    # * rtsps://existing-url -> the stream is pulled from another RTSP server / camera with RTSPS
    # * rtmp://existing-url -> the stream is pulled from another RTMP server / camera
    # * rtmps://existing-url -> the stream is pulled from another RTMP server / camera with RTMPS
    # * http://existing-url/stream.m3u8 -> the stream is pulled from another HLS server
    # * https://existing-url/stream.m3u8 -> the stream is pulled from another HLS server with HTTPS
    # * udp://ip:port -> the stream is pulled from UDP, by listening on the specified IP and port
    # * redirect -> the stream is provided by another path or server
    # * rpiCamera -> the stream is provided by a Raspberry Pi Camera
    source: publisher

    # If the source is an RTSP or RTSPS URL, this is the protocol that will be used to
    # pull the stream. available values are "automatic", "udp", "multicast", "tcp".
