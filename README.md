## Architecture:

## Development

Developing on this locally is a pain (because there are a few secrets involved). 
There is a dockerfile/docker-compose.yml. I don't guarantee that it works because we can't currently use it in production.
To get this running locally follow these steps:

### Setup IPs

In `/etc/hosts` add this: 
```
127.0.0.1  db
```

### Setup Database

- get mariadb from your favourite package manager or docker (I recommend this option)
- `docker run --name mariadb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=example -p 3306:3306 -d mariadb:latest`
- create the database `tumlive`

### Get go running locally

- Install go1.17
- Preferably use Jetbrains GoLand and open this project
- Edit Configuration > Environment 
  - Add environment variables from `variables-backend.example.env`.
- Start the app
- Head over to localhost:8081
- Happy coding! :sparkles:
