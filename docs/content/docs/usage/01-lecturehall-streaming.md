## Streaming from a lecture hall with installed SMPs

This guide contains information on how to stream from a lecture hall at TUM.

### How to stream

To stream your lecture from a SMP equipped lecture hall, follow these steps:
1. Create your course
2. Create a lecture
3. Add a room to the lecture
4. Set the date and time of the lecture (**Important:** Please also set the end time)

In most cases your lecture gets imported from TUMonline. If you want to stream a lecture that is not in TUMonline,
you can create a new course and lecture in gocast.
