# Automatic Broadcasting and Recording of Auditoriums

With gocast, you can easily stream your lectures to the internet. This allows students to follow the lecture from home
or on the go. If you wish so, recording of the lecture is also available for later viewing.

For this purpose, we have installed Streaming Media Processors (SMPs) in many lecture halls at TUM. These devices are
capable of capturing the video and audio of the lecture and sending it to our servers for broadcasting.

For a guide on how to stream from a lecture hall, please refer to the [Lecture Hall Streaming Guide]({{<ref 01-lecturehall-streaming.md>}}).

# Self-Streaming using OBS, Zoom or other Software
You can also stream your lectures yourself with any streaming software you like. We recommend OBS for this purpose.

For instructions on how to self-stream, please refer to the [Self-Streaming Guide]({{<ref 02-self-streaming.md>}}).
