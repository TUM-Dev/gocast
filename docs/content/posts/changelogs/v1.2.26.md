Changes in this release:

## Features

- [allow mp4 downloads from hls edge server](https://github.com/joschahenningsen/TUM-Live/pull/931) by [@joschahenningsen](https://github.com/joschahenningsen)
  - Video files are now downloaded from the edge server instead of pulling the mp4 file from the mass storage. 
    This step helps us get rid of the dependence of video files in the mass storage, thus saving 50% disk space.
    The long term goal is to only store hls segments and discard the mp4 files after they have been converted to a hls stream.
- [Use MediaMTX for Selfstreams](https://github.com/joschahenningsen/TUM-Live/pull/994) by [@joschahenningsen](https://github.com/joschahenningsen)
  - Selfstreams are now delivered to the worker using [MediaMTX](https://github.com/aler9/mediamtx).
    This package has proven to be more reliable and much more actively maintained than nginx with the rtmp module.
  - MediaMTX is now also embedded in the docker container of the worker. This allows easier deployment and self-streaming to any worker.

## Bugfixes

- [Fix chat replay message scrolling](https://github.com/joschahenningsen/TUM-Live/pull/996) by [@MatthiasReumann](https://github.com/MatthiasReumann)
  - When watching a video on demand with the chat following the stream times, the messages automatically scrolled to were offset
    by a bit and thus out of the visible area. This is now fixed.
- [Fix Firefox file drop](https://github.com/joschahenningsen/TUM-Live/pull/999) by [@MatthiasReumann](https://github.com/MatthiasReumann)
  - Dropping files as lecture attatchments did not work in Firefox. This is now fixed.
- [Fix skip silence button fadeout](https://github.com/joschahenningsen/TUM-Live/pull/995) by [@MatthiasReumann](https://github.com/MatthiasReumann)
  - The skip silence button would not fade out when the video was silent. This is now fixed.
