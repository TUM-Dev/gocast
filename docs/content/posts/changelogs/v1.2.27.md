This release contains one small bugfix.

- [fix edge server tests and log import](https://github.com/joschahenningsen/TUM-Live/commit/04aa8ca42e32cd9684ee815e445902125981b5c5) by [@joschahenningsen](https://github.com/joschahenningsen)
  - This fixes an issue with the latest deployment where the wrong log package was imported in the edge submodule.
