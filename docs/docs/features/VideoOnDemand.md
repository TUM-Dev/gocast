# Video On Demand

Video On Demand (VoD) is a feature that allows you to upload videos to the server and stream them to the students. This
feature is useful for hosting videos that you want to share with your students.

You can also record your live classes and get them automatically uploaded to the server. This way, students who missed
the live class can watch the recording later.
