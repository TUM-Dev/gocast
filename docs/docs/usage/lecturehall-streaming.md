# Streaming from a lecture hall with installed SMPs

This guide contains information on how to stream from a lecture hall at TUM.

## How to stream

To stream your lecture from a SMP equipped lecture hall, follow these steps:
1. Create your course
2. Create a lecture
3. Add a room to the lecture
4. Set the date and time of the lecture (**Important:** Please also set the end time)

In most cases, your lecture gets imported from TUMOnline. If you want to stream a lecture that is not in TUMOnline,
you can create a new course and lecture in GoCast.
