# Video 

## VoD Sections 

Structuring lectures into sections makes lectures more rewatchable. 
A click on a section will jump to the given timestamp. Hence, students can repeat
lectures section-wise.

## Create Sections 

On the Admin page's sidebar, navigate to:

`Courses > 'Term' > 'Your Course' - Settings` 

There you will find a list of lectures. Sections can only be added 
to VoD streams. (Visualized by the Green VoD Symbol) 

The UI for managing video sections is very intuitive.
