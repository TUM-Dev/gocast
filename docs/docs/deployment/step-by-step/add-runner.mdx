# Runner

Runners are responsible for recording your lecture halls, transcoding recordings and pushing these to your shared storage.

:::caution
Runners will soon replace the current TUMLive Workers, but until they have released for production, use them with caution.

## Add a Runner to the GoCast network

<Tabs
  defaultValue="docker"
  values={[
    {label: 'Docker', value: 'docker'},
    {label: 'Manually', value: 'manually'},
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="docker">

1. Run the TUM-Live-Runner docker container with the school token and make sure to include its hostname:

   ```sh
   docker run -d -p 50057:50057 \
   -e "STORAGE_PATH=/path/to/mass" \
   -e "SEGMENT_PATH=/path/to/livestreams" \
   -e "REC_PATH=/path/to/recordings" \
   -e "REALHOST=$(hostname)" \
   -e "TOKEN=<your-school-token>" \
   -e "GOCAST_SERVER=live.carlobortolan.com:50056" \
   docker.io/carlobortolan/runner:latest
   ```

2. _Optional_: Join your docker node cluster:
   ```sh
   # Refer to your manager node on which token to use here:
   docker swarm join --token ABC-1243-DEFG 1.2.3.4:2377
   ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="manually">

1. Clone the GoCast repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tum-Dev/gocast
   ```
2. Change into the Runner directory:

   ```sh
   cd gocast && cd runner
   ```

3. Start the Runner with the school token and make sure to include its hostname:
   ```sh
   STORAGE_PATH=/path/to/mass \
   SEGMENT_PATH=/path/to/livestreams \
   REC_PATH=/path/to/recordings \
   REALHOST=$(hostname) \
   TOKEN=<your-school-token> \
   GOCAST_SERVER=live.carlobortolan.com:50056 \
   go run ./cmd/runner/main.go
   ```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Verify successful deployment

Once a Runner has been added successfully, you should be able to see it in the ["resources"-tab](http://live.carlobortolan.com:8081/admins/schools) of the admin dashboard.

Here's an example of how it should look, if you added two runners:
