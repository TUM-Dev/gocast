# Example Deployment

Here's an example of how the GoCast network can look like:

The main instance is managed centrally by TUM, while the other node clusters are connected individually by the schools.

Each school can decide how many resources it wants to allocate to each service depending on their expected usage.

Optionally, a school can add additional services, such as the _Voice Service_ for subtitling live streams and VoDs.
