# Live Chat

## Enable Live Chat

On the Admin page's sidebar navigate to: 

`Courses > 'Term' > 'Your Course' - Settings` 

There you will find a few checkboxes to enable/disable the chat 
and a variety of different chat related features.

## Moderate Chat

### Approve Messages

If `Enable Moderate Chat` is set, new chat messages need to be approved by an admin of the course before being visible for all.

### Remove messages

If necessary, a message can also be removed.

### Resolve messages

Messages can be marked as 'resolved'. 
This can be extremely useful when messages contain questions which have been answered.

After that a message is visibly depicted as such:

### Anonymous Chat

If `Allow Anonymous Messages` is set, users may hide their identity by 
sending their messages as the user _'Anonymous'_.

## Interact with Chat 

### Chat Polls 

A click on `Create Poll` at the bottom of the chat opens a dialog. The form 
is very intuitive. If additional answers are needed, press ``+`` to add another option.

If closed, the result will be nicely depicted with a graph at the top of the chat:

At the time of writing this document (March 2022) polls are **single choice**. 

### Address users 

The insertion of an `@`-Symbol in the chat-input triggers the display of 
a list of non-Anonymous users. A click or ENTER appends the chosen user to the addresses. Alternatively, navigation via
UP and DOWN arrows is also possible.
